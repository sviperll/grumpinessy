Grumpinessy
===========

![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.sviperll/grumpinessy/badge.png?style=flat)

This project consists of several parts:

 1. [my personal Checkstyle configuration](src/main/resources/com/github/sviperll/grumpinessy/checkstyle.xml)
 2. implementation of custom Checkstyle checks that are used in my checkstyle configuration
 3. my personal Code Style Guide

Using Checkstyle configuration
------------------------------

Comming soon...
The project is to be released on Maven Central, then
you can simply apply my checkstyle config by
configuring checkstyle plugin in your build configuration.

Code Style Guide
----------------

My style guide is a little eclectic.
I mostly try to avoid those things that I feel are pretty well understood and wide-spread and
instead I focus mostly on those things that I do differently or
which I feel not yet caught up in the mainstream.

Read the guide [here](CODE_STYLE.md)
